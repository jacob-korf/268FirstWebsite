    This website looks clean and simple. All information is easy to reach and easy to use. The transition is nice, but the timing of it feels a little off. It is very simple, but I think it might work better since its so simple. It comes together nicely and
    works well in a mobile format. The fonts work nicely together. The contact page is nice and easy and would be nice when it does fully send messages to my email. I love yoga, so I’m glad its included as a section. The blog is pretty basic, but will
    probably be better once more blog posts get added. All in all, it’s a nice website. Its pretty simple and could be a little cleaner, but otherwise does the job.
